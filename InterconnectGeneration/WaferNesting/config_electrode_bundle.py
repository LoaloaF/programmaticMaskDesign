"""Config -- electrode bundles from the electrode_bundle generator.

General: point BUNDLE_DXF at any bundle the generator produced and set COUNT. Nothing in
this file is specific to one magnetic ID.

# and stops as soon as the layout is legal; it has no density objective and will not fill
# the wafer for you. See HANDOVER.md 3.1 before raising it: past ~40 pieces the solver
# gets slow, and for a near-rectangular strip a structured nest fits far more (66 vs 24
